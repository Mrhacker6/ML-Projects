# Dynamic Pricing

Dynamic pricing refers to a flexible pricing strategy where the price of a product or service fluctuates based on real-time market conditions. It’s commonly used in industries such as travel (airlines, hotels), e-commerce, entertainment (tickets), and utilities. The goal of this project is to implement a system that allows businesses to automatically adjust prices based on pre-defined variables.

*Key Factors Affecting Dynamic Pricing:

Demand: Prices increase during high demand and decrease when demand is low.

Competition: Prices may be adjusted based on competitors' pricing in the market.

Inventory Levels: Low inventory may lead to higher prices, while surplus stock can lead to discounts.

Time Sensitivity: Certain periods (holidays, peak times, seasons) may have higher prices.

Customer Segmentation: Different prices for different customer segments (e.g., new vs. loyal customers).

External Events: Special events or market trends can also trigger price adjustments.

**What is Dynamic Pricing For?

Dynamic pricing is primarily used to:

Maximize Revenue: By charging higher prices during peak demand, businesses can increase profits.

Optimize Inventory: By adjusting prices based on stock levels, businesses can avoid excess inventory or stockouts.

Stay Competitive: By reacting to competitor prices in real-time, companies can offer the best possible deal without losing market share.

Improve Customer Targeting: Segmenting customers allows businesses to tailor prices based on willingness to pay or loyalty.

Balance Supply and Demand: Dynamic pricing helps to balance product availability with demand, ensuring smoother operations.
